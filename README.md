## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a telephone-esque game using Quantum Key Distribution, allowing for this concept to become more intellectually accessible to the public. Our code generates a series of random bits and bases on which to create qubits which encode the message. Our reciever then measures the message with his own random bases. They then share their bases and throw out the bits without matching bases. They now have their own secure keys! Our program can also model the impact on the keys with any number of interceptors as well. 

## Creativity
Our original vision for this project was to emulate a simplified version of Quantum Key Distribution where players can fill the positions of sender, reciever, and "eavesdropper". The sender would attempt to securely and correctly transmit a message to the reciever, while the "eavesdropper" would try to intermittently intercept the message.

## Tutorial
During the course of this hackathon, we weren't able to create graphics for our game so currently it is a command line game. Just run our file with any python interpreter such as python3 and it will print to the command line.

## Our experience at iQuHack
We all thought that iQuHack was really fun, and the people here were really nice. It was a great opportunity to meet other people who were interested in similar fields, and we thought it was a really interesting experience.
